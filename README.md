# Mineslayer
A console-based Minesweeper inspired puzzle game where you control a player and the objective is to reach the goal while dodging mines. 

Use the arrow keys to move, dodge the mines, and reach the goal!
The game gets progressively harder as each level is completed.

Press escape to quit the game.
